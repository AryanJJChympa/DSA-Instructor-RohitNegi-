// 1. Write a C++ program to implement a class called Circle that has private member variables for radius. Include member functions to calculate the circle's area and circumference.

#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

// class Circle{
//     private:
//     double rad;

//     public:
//     void areaOfCircle(double rad){
//         cout<<"The area of circle is: "<<3.14*rad*rad;
//     }

// };

// int main(){
//     Circle c;
//     c.areaOfCircle(20);
// }

//2. Write a C++ program to create a class called Rectangle that has private member variables for length and width. Implement member functions to calculate the rectangle's area and perimeter.

class Rectangle{
    double length;
    double width;

    void AreaofRectangle()
